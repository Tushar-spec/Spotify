Bias in the spotify recommendation algorithm 


Music streaming platforms rely on recommendation algorithms to personalize user experiences, shaping how individuals discover and engage with music. However, concerns have emerged regarding potential biases in these algorithms, particularly in relation to gender and regional demographics. This study investigates whether Spotify’s recommendation system exhibits systematic biases by analyzing playlists from four distinct user profiles: Male and Female users in both India and Germany.
Using web scraping and API integration, playlist data was collected, and key audio features— including danceability, energy, loudness, and acoustic-ness, were extracted for statistical analysis. ANOVA tests were applied to identify differences in recommendations across user profiles. The results reveal significant trends: male users receive playlists with louder, high- energy tracks, while female users are recommended songs with greater danceability and acoustic characteristics. Furthermore, regional differences were observed, with Spotify favoring faster-paced music for users in Germany and more acoustic-heavy recommendations for users in India.
These findings suggest that Spotify’s algorithm may not only reflect user preferences but also reinforce cultural and gender-based listening patterns. Such biases could limit the diversity of music exposure, subtly shaping user preferences over time. The presence of algorithmic bias in personalized music recommendations raises critical concerns regarding fairness and transparency in artificial intelligence-driven content curation.
This research highlights the need for more equitable and transparent recommendation systems that promote diverse music discovery rather than perpetuating stereotypes. Future work should explore strategies to mitigate bias in algorithmic recommendations, ensuring that streaming platforms offer a more inclusive and unbiased user experience.
